Dear diary,
today is my birthday! We did a lot to celebrate, like getting cake and watching the sunset. It was very pretty, and it made me realize how important being around people is for me. 
We also went to the beach, where I played in the sand with a couple of my friends. It was very fun. We went back home and decorated candles and cookies we baked fresh from scratch today. We did a lot today, but I really enjoyed it.

Adding something else...
